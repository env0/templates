## What is this?

This is an example of a workflow template. In here, you define all environments and deployments that take part in the workflow.
This allows you to create stack dependencies.

In this specific scenario: 
- Initial deployment would start deployment of two stacks: `rootService1` and `rootService2`
- Once both "root" services finish deploying, two other stacks start deployment - `middleService1` and `middleService2`
- Once `middleService1` finishes, it triggers `finalService` stack deployment
- Once all above stacks have fully deployed, the deployment is done

This example deploys `null resource` which means this is purely for example purposes and does not actually deploy anything. 

## How to run in env0?

### Prerequisites

This example assumes you have a template named `null` in your organization.

To successfully run - you can either create that template in your organization or alter `env0.workflow.yml` to match a different template name.

### Defining the template

- In env0, create a new template of type "env0 workflow"
- On the VCS step, pick the repository containing this file, and put `misc/workflow-environment-basic-dependencies` under "env0 Workflow Location"
- Save the template

### Running the template

Now that the template is defined, you can simply run it in any env0 project using the "Create New Environment" button. 
Make sure to pick the template defined in the last step.

**When creating the environment make sure to define an environment variable named WORKSPACE_PREFIX with your desired workspace prefix as its value**
